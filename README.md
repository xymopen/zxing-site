# ZXing

## What is ZXing?

> [ZXing][1] ("zebra crossing") is an open-source, multi-format 1D/2D barcode image processing library implemented in Java, with ports to other languages.

## What is this repository?

This repository hosts a clone of the [Online Decoder](https://zxing.org/w/decode.jspx) and [QR Code Generator](https://zxing.appspot.com/generator) of the original [ZXing][1] project, stripped the Java server with [@zxing/library][2] and work fully in the browser. It should hopefully feel more responsive and reliable.
